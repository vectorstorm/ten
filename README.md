In-progress development for my Game in a Week #10.  Currently just creates an
empty window which is dismissed by 'ESC'.

Compilation will require [cmake][1], and some sort of compiler.

Required libraries include:
 - OpenGL
 - Glew
 - SDL
 - SDL-image
 - SDL-mixer
 - Box2D

Full details at [my blog][2].
